<h5>Why The Peak District?</h5>
<h2>The Peaks, a mesmerizing landscape</h2>
<p>The Peak District was designated a national park in 1951. It covers 555 sq miles (1,438km) in the heart of England. It reaches into five counties and is the most accessible national park in the country – close to Sheffield, Manchester, Nottingham and Derby. It receives more than 13 million visitors each year and an estimated 20 million people live within an hour’s travel.</p>
<p>The Peak District is made up of impressive gritstone edges, steep limestone dales and rolling hills and farmland. The highest point is Kinder Scout at 2,086ft (636 metres). There are 26,000 miles of dry stone wall in the Peak District – equivalent to a wall around the Earth.
